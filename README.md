This program simulates the function of an X-86 CPU. It comes complete with the assembler, simulator, and a "debugger" in the form of a readable memory dump. I've included all of the .asm files I used to test the program, and the problem log at the bottom in which I discuss my development/debugging process.

Note that this project was created in fall of 2023 for my Computer Architecture class using the framework provided by my instructor, so certain bad practices like the lumping of the entire project into one file, and the excessive use of global variables, are the result of that. It was sort of an old-school class taught by an old school instructor, and it was great fun! But of course the resulting code was more academic than production-ready.
